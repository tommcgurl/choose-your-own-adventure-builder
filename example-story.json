You flick it on and a florecent bulb flashes and stutters on. As the light illuminates the room you can see it is a tiny room with a set of double doors to the back about 20 feet. They are elevator doors. The only other thing in the room is the elevator control panel, and a sign that reads \"Maintenance Eleveator: Floor 1\". You run into the room and see the control panel for the elevator has an up button and a down button.",
