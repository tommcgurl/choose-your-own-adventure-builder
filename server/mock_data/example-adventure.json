As you vision starts to clear you realize you are not in your bed, you are onboard the ship. Things start to come rushing back and your surroundings are now familiar. You remember you were in a cryo chamber for the journey off planet to a nearby system. It fealt like no time went by at all. As you start to wake you realize your body has not reacted to the sirens still blaring WAAAAHHH WAAAAAHH WAAAHHHHh. Shit! You realize this isn't a routine wakeup; this is an emergency. You spring up from the cyro-bed and take a look around. The other beds are empty.",

You instinctively rais your hand to the side of the inside wall blindly searching for a light switch. You find one! You flick it on and a florecent bulb flashes and stutters on. As the light illuminates the room you can see it is a tiny room with a set of double doors to the back about 20 feet. They are elevator doors. The only other thing in the room is the elevator control panel, and a sign that reads \"Maintenance Eleveator: Floor 1\". You run into the room and see the control panel for the elevator has an up button and a down button.",
